# 🔒 Password Verification and Access Control System

## 📌 About the Project

This project explores the basic principles of system access control through password verification.  
The goal is to simulate a simplified version of authentication logic often found in login systems, emphasizing input validation and conditional access control.

The application verifies a password entered by the user:

- ✅ If the password is correct, access is granted and a success message is displayed.  
- ❌ If the password is incorrect, access is denied and the system is simulated to be "shut down."

Though simple, this logic forms the backbone of more advanced identity verification systems used in secure environments.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used in the Project

- **Language**: C# / Python *(adjust depending on actual implementation)*
- **Platform**: .NET Console Application / Terminal CLI
- **Executable Output**: Compiled `.exe` file

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user launches the application.  
2. The system prompts for a password.  
3. The entered password is checked against a predefined secure string.  
4. Depending on the result:  
   - ✅ **Correct** → "Login successful" message is shown.  
   - ❌ **Incorrect** → "System shutting down" message is displayed and execution is terminated.

## 🔐 Security & Learning Focus

- **Basic Authentication Logic**: Understanding conditional structures for access control.  
- **Error Handling**: Managing failed login attempts.  
- **Application Flow Control**: Simulating system exit after failure.

This project demonstrates how even simple logic flows can introduce key principles of authentication systems.

## 💡 Further Improvements

- Mask password input (e.g., show asterisks or hide input entirely).
- Add a limited attempt mechanism (e.g., allow only 3 tries).
- Use encrypted password storage instead of plaintext.
- Implement multi-user authentication using external data sources (JSON, database, etc).
